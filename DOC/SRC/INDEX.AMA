%hSmall Make

There is MAKE tool for `Small C by J. Hendrix`. Good compiler, but
toolchain definitly must be enhanced.

The second reason to recreate this utility - absent free MAKE for DOS 16-bit
(real mode). DJGPP offers just DPMI-based tools.

This MAKE does not support variables - smallest as possible. MAKE is real
small - just 5KB on your hard drive!

Source code 100%% wroten in Small C (with Assembler inlines).

%hNotes about command execution in MS-DOS.

By default, MAKE start search EXE and COM in current directory and in PATH.

If found - run.

If not found (it should be BAT or built-in command like COPY or DEL) - try
execute

     COMMAND.COM /C build_command

Path to COMMAND.COM will be received from COMSPEC env variable


So, if You wrote "cc mycool.c" it could start

     K:\SMALLC20\CC.EXE mycool.c

or

     K:\SMALLC22\CC.EXE mycool.c

depends to directory order in PATH.
